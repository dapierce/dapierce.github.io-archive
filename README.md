# [dapierce.github.io](https://dapierce.github.io)

My personal portfolio website, hosted by Github Pages and served as a static site by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

It uses these plugins:
- [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
- [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge)

It incorporates styling elements from the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme and uses code styling css from https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes/
