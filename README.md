My personal portfolio website, hosted by Github Pages and served as a static site by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

It uses these plugins:
- [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
- [jekyll-minifier](https://github.com/digitalsparky/jekyll-minifier)
- [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge)

Math is rendered using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), which I was able to integrate into Jekyll with the help of an article written by Xu Cheng: https://xuc.me/blog/KaTeX-and-Jekyll/

It incorporates styling elements from the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme and uses code styling css from https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes/
