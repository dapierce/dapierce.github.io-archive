Testing out static [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blogging using GitHub, and using Markdown to write! It seems to be working...

## Is this really working? Are my markdown posts getting rendered correctly?

Not sure if it is?

By the way, does `my-sick-code` look ok:

	function lookAtCodeStyle(observation) {
		if(observation === ugly) {
			return "Try again";
		}
		
		return "Success!";
	}

I wonder how that looks on a Jekyll rendered page?

### Things to do:
* Set up basic directories
* Set up Jekyll on my own laptop
* Build my own templates and portfolio site
