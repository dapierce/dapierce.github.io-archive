Testing out static [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blogging using GitHub, and using Markdown to write! It seems to be working...

## Is this really working? Are my markdown posts getting rendered correctly?

Not sure if it is?

### Things to do:
* Set up basic directories
* Set up Jekyll on my own laptop
* Build my own templates and portfolio site
