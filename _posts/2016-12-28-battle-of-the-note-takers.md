I use a lot of different programs to take notes, hoping they will serve my needs. And ultimately, every one I've tried serves up a perfectly functional text editor/thought space/echo chamber. But I have a sickness, and after using any program for a couple months, its small, nagging problems get more and more visible to me. These are never big deals. I shouldn't be so unnerved by the problems.

But I am, and eventually I leave for (supposedly) greener note taking pastures.

## Evernote

I began with [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/). Its a big, complicated thing, but its interface, especially in the past couple years, has gotten streamlined and is now slick to a point where it feels pleasant even on Windows. I have been using it for years and have built up a massive searchable collection of web-clippings, photographed documents, hand written and hand-typed notes. Earlier this year though, they made a far-reaching change to their free plan to only allow 2 synced devices. This made me reassess my use of Evernote: if it can be changed so dramatically with so little advance notice, what else might get changed in the future?

## OneNote

So I migrated everything over to [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/). OneNote is bigger. It's Microsoft in classic "everything including the kitchen sink" fashion, and just using the program feels bloated even though functionally it isn't actually too different from Evernote. They have the same rich-text formatting, they allow full clippings of websites (although Evernote's website clipper is much better at extracting content than OneNote's), they allow for search on text within images and documents and they both use a notebook/notes metaphor. Where OneNote differs, and perhaps a big part of its problem is the way that it splits data between notebooks. Every notebook is a separate file, and it feels a lot slower to move between notebooks in OneNote than it did in Evernote. Although I was satisfied by its power and features, I found myself wanting less distraction and faster, snappier text-based notes so I tried looking for smaller alternatives.

## Simplenote

[Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) is multi-platform, fast, and easily the snappiest app on this list. It syncs everywhere, but it only does simple text and nothing else. As much as I'd like to live in a word where I only needed simple text notes, it turns out I have years and years of archived documents, images and hypertext links that I want to just work.

## iCloud Notes

Now that [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) allows me to log in on any computer and write and use notes, and given the recent updates that add some umph to the iOS and Mac OS apps, Apple's native option has actually become a really close competitor to Evernote. Since its integrated into Mac OS and iOS those apps are super fast and responsive, and the web version can be used everywhere else so device-syncing is not an issue. I might use iCloud exclusively for my note-taking if it had a halfway decent web clipper.

## And the winner is...Pragmatism (you just have to stick with what works)

Ultimately, I have lots of data that can not be constrained to txt. If I didn't I would just type away on Simplenote or iCloud Notes, but I need rich-text, I need images, I need to search those images with OCR, I need to sync with 4 devices and most important of all I need web-clipping. OneNote does all of this, and although it still has some ground to gain on the web-clipping compared to Evernote, it works well enough on most websites. My issues with its speed persist, but in the end, if the program is always open in the background, I find searching and moving between notes goes quickly enough.

If you're on the fence on using OneNote because its interface feels a little too "tabby," look for the "Experimental Features" setting in Preferences/Options. The new "experimental" interface feels better and faster, and all the categories and notebooks stay on the left panel, mirroring most other note-taking apps.
